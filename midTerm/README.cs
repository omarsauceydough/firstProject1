//For my midterm project, I utilized arrays, loops, conditional logic and character conversion to build a simple hangman game. I used arrays to stor the words for each category, which there were 3 of. The program then goes on to use conditional logic via if-else statements to handle the main menu and selection, which defaults to the animals category if unrecognized or invalid input is given. For loops are then used to create blank spaces at the start and handles the game until a player wins or loses. String commands were also used to check if guesses are in the hidden word, build the display with blank spaces and correct guesses, and to track which letters have already been guessed.
